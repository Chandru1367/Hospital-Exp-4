# Exp - 4 HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To draw a UML diagram for a Hospital management system

# SRS (Procedure):

1 . The patient books and confirms an appointment with the receptionist.

2 . After registration, the patient undergoes check-ups and tests.

3 . A prescription is written based on the diagnosis.

4 . The system checks if the prescribed medicine is available.

5 . If available, medicine is dispensed; if not, it is procured first.

6 . Finally, stocks are updated and the patient pays the bills.
